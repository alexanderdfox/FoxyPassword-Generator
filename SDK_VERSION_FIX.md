# ðŸ”§ Windows SDK Version Fix Guide

## Problem Description

**Error Message:**
```
The Windows SDK version 10.0.26100.0 does not support 32-bit ARM development. 
To continue, please select a windows SDK version older than 10.0.26100 in the project property pages 
or by right-clicking the solution and selecting "Retarget solution".
```

## Root Cause

- **Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0** removed support for 32-bit ARM development
- Your project is configured for **ARM platform** which is not needed for a password generator
- The project needs to be **retargeted** to a compatible SDK version

## Solution

### Option 1: Visual Studio Retarget (Recommended)

1. **Open Visual Studio 2022**
2. **Open** `FoxyPassword Generator.sln`
3. **Right-click** on the solution in Solution Explorer
4. **Select** "Retarget Solution"
5. **Choose** Windows SDK version: `10.0.22621.0`
6. **Click** "OK"

### Option 2: Project Properties

1. **Right-click** on "FoxyPassword Generator" project
2. **Properties**
3. **Configuration Properties** â†’ **General**
4. **Target Platform Version**: Change to `10.0.22621.0`
5. **Click** "Apply"

### Option 3: Remove ARM Platform

1. **Right-click** on the solution
2. **Configuration Manager**
3. **Platform** dropdown â†’ **Remove** ARM
4. **Keep** only:
   - âœ… **x64** (64-bit Windows) - Recommended
   - âœ… **x86** (32-bit Windows) - Legacy support

## Updated Configuration

### Supported Platforms:
- **x64** (64-bit Windows) - Modern systems, recommended
- **x86** (32-bit Windows) - Legacy support, older systems

### Removed Platforms:
- **ARM** - Not needed for password generator

### Windows SDK Version:
- **10.0.22621.0** - Compatible, stable version

## Why This Fix Works

### 1. **Compatible SDK Version**
- `10.0.22621.0` is stable and widely supported
- No ARM compatibility issues
- Full WinUI 3 support

### 2. **Removed ARM Support**
- Password generators don't need ARM support
- Reduces complexity and build time
- Focuses on main platforms (x64/x86)

### 3. **Maintained Security**
- All security features remain intact
- Cryptographically secure random generation
- Enhanced security with WinUI 3

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix:

1. **Build** the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
2. **Check** for any remaining errors
3. **Test** the application functionality
4. **Verify** security features work

## Expected Results

âœ… **Build succeeds** without SDK errors  
âœ… **x64 and x86 platforms** supported  
âœ… **All security features** working  
âœ… **WinUI 3 functionality** intact  
âœ… **Modern Windows 11** design  

## Alternative Solutions

### If you need ARM support:
1. **Install older Windows SDK** (10.0.19041.0)
2. **Use different project configuration**
3. **Consider separate ARM build**

### If you want latest SDK:
1. **Remove ARM platform** completely
2. **Use SDK 10.0.26100.0** for x64/x86 only
3. **Focus on main platforms**
